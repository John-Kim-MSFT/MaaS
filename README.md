# MaaS

### Repo for a high code vs. low code experience of implementing MaaS in Azure AI studio.
  <li> High code: uses LangChain tooling for answering a question re: MaaS in Azure using a vector store + embedding of Azure AI support documentation
  <li> Low code: imported directly from Azure AI studio that uses On Your Data (Azure AI support documentation) and the Index (embeddings + vector store) to create a chatbot
